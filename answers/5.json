      "value": "When you Zap liquidity, it normally requires multiple transactions, which you'll be prompted to confirm. However, transactions on Ethereum compete to be confirmed through an auction-like process, bidding by gas price (show as Gwei in your wallet). If the average bidding gas price is much higher than you selected under Speed before Confirming a Zap or when you modified the gas price in MetaMask, your transaction can get stuck. Sometimes we get unlucky choosing a gas price right as gas prices skyrocket (see recommended gas prices at ethgasstation.info).\n\nTransactions submitted by an Ethereum address will processed sequentially so if transaction #1 is stuck, transaction #2 will be stuck waiting until 1 confirms. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EcJNCapRq8&ab_channel=DeFiTutorialswithDeFiDad) a helpful video tutorial from DeFi Dad on how you fix a pending transaction."
